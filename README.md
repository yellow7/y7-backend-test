# Back-end Development Test

## Goal

The goal of this test project is to develop a secure YouTube search form using the YouTube API. A successful search should display a maximum of 10 results on the `results.html` page. Ensure this table only lists the *ID* and the *Title* of the video.

Create a local environment file that has your Google API key in this and hide it in the `.gitignore`. Do not push your API key to any repository.

0. Secure your search form.
0. Validate user input.
0. Document your code with comments.
